test - C# project which is the backend, make sure its running. Use Visual Studio for that.
UserManagement - Angular 8 project. Launch command prompt, goto UserManagement directory, type in command 'ng serve' which will start the application. Navigate to the local host address mentioned.

Let me know if you are stuck at any moment of time.
Thanks.
